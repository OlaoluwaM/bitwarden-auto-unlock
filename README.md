# Bitwarden Vault Auto Unlock

This is a simple script that automates the unlocking of your Bitwarden vault in the terminal ONLY. In order to use this script, you must have installed the Bitwarden CLI and signed in

**NOTE:** Rather than just calling the script in the terminal you will need to `source` so the session token can
be applied to the shell session in which the script was invoked
